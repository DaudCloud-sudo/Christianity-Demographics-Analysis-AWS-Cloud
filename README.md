## Project Overview

This project focuses on visualizing the distribution and demographics of Christianity worldwide. It involves gathering data from various sources, processing it, and creating visual dashboards using AWS S3 and AWS QuickSight.

## Data Collection

The most challenging part of this project was gathering authentic data from reliable sources. The data was collected from the following sources:
- **[Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org)**
- **[Statista](https://www.statista.com)**

## Data Processing

The data was meticulously processed to ensure accuracy and relevance. This involved:
1. Extracting data from various APIs and websites.
2. Cleaning and organizing the data.
3. Uploading the processed data to AWS S3 for storage.

## Visualizations

Using AWS QuickSight, I created various visualizations to represent the data effectively. These visualizations include pie charts, flow charts, and tables.

## Steps Taken

### Step 1: Data Collection

I started by gathering data from different sources such as Pew Research Center and Statista. This required extensive searching and validation to ensure the data was authentic.

### Step 2: Data Processing

Once the data was collected, I processed it using various tools and techniques. This included cleaning the data to remove any inconsistencies and organizing it for better analysis.

### Step 3: Uploading Data to AWS S3

I uploaded the processed data to AWS S3. This involved:
1. Creating an S3 bucket.
2. Uploading the data files to the bucket.
3. Setting appropriate permissions for the data.

### Step 4: Creating Visualizations with AWS QuickSight

Using AWS QuickSight, I created various dashboards to visualize the data. This involved:
1. Connecting AWS QuickSight to the S3 bucket containing the data.
2. Creating datasets in QuickSight.
3. Designing visualizations such as pie charts, flow charts, and tables.
