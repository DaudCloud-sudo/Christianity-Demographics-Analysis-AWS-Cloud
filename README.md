# Christianity-Demographics-Analysis-AWS-Cloud-Quicksight

This repo contains data and analysis on Christianity demographics, including branches, denominations, and adherents. It features visualizations and insights into global religious distribution and historical events. Perfect for exploring and understanding Christian demographics.

## Dataset

The dataset includes information on:
- Branches of Christianity
- Denominations
- Major Historical Events
- Key Figures
- Geographic Distribution of Adherents

## Project Overview
This project focuses on visualizing the distribution and demographics of Christianity worldwide. It involves gathering data from various sources, processing it, and creating visual dashboards using AWS S3 and AWS QuickSight.

## Data Collection
The most challenging part of this project was gathering authentic data from reliable sources. The data was collected from the following sources:
- **Pew Research Center**
- **Statista**

## Data Processing
The data was meticulously processed to ensure accuracy and relevance. This involved:
1. Extracting data from various APIs and websites.
2. Cleaning and organizing the data.
3. Uploading the processed data to AWS S3 for storage.

## Visualizations
Using AWS QuickSight, I created various visualizations to represent the data effectively. These visualizations include pie charts, flow charts, and tables.

## Steps Taken

### Step 1: Data Collection
I started by gathering data from different sources such as Pew Research Center and Statista. This required extensive searching and validation to ensure the data was authentic.

### Step 2: Data Processing
Once the data was collected, I processed it using various tools and techniques. This included cleaning the data to remove any inconsistencies and organizing it for better analysis.

### Step 3: Uploading Data to AWS S3
I uploaded the processed data to AWS S3. This involved:
1. Creating an S3 bucket.
2. Uploading the data files to the bucket.
3. Setting appropriate permissions for the data.

### Step 4: Creating Visualizations with AWS QuickSight
Using AWS QuickSight, I created various dashboards to visualize the data. This involved:
1. Connecting AWS QuickSight to the S3 bucket containing the data.
2. Creating datasets in QuickSight.
3. Designing visualizations such as pie charts, flow charts, and tables.

## Challenges
The most difficult part was gathering authentic data from APIs or websites. However, I efficiently managed this by verifying sources and cross-referencing data to ensure its reliability.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to give credit to the following sources for providing data:
- **Pew Research Center**
- **Statista**

## Guide on Using AWS S3 and QuickSight

### AWS S3
1. **Create a Bucket**: Log in to your AWS account, go to the S3 service, and create a new bucket.
2. **Upload Data**: Click on the newly created bucket and upload your data files.
3. **Set Permissions**: Ensure the correct permissions are set to allow access from QuickSight.

### AWS QuickSight
1. **Connect to S3**: In AWS QuickSight, go to the datasets section and connect to your S3 bucket.
2. **Create Datasets**: Import your data from S3 and create datasets for analysis.
3. **Design Visualizations**: Use the QuickSight dashboard to create and customize your visualizations.
